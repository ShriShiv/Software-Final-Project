# Software Final Project

## Patient Monitoring Client Server System

The purpose of this project is to develop a patient monitoring client server system for patients with sleep disorders like sleep apnea. This system enables patients to upload their information and snoring files, which will then be stored on a server (MongoDb is used for storing the data). The provider can access the patient data and provide suggestions based on the data.

The system allows the following functionalities:

- Patients can upload their data to the server.
- The data is stored on the server and can be accessed by the provider.
- The provider can view the data and provide suggestions to the patient.
- This project aims to improve patient care for people with sleep disorders, making it easier for both patients and providers to access and manage data related to patient health.
